## **The Mole Concept**


- By finding instances in nature where two amounts of different elements have equal numbers of atoms, early chemists were able to find the relative masses of the atoms of each element.

- Relative masses can be used to compare the number of particles in samples of substances.

- For convenience chemists initially agreed to define a standard number or “lump” of particles as the number of hydrogen atoms in 1.0 g of hydrogen. This number is called 1 mole (latin for “lump”).

- From the periodic table we can see that lithium, for example, has a relative mass that is 6.9 times heavier than hydrogen. So if we weigh out 6.9 g of lithium, it will have the same number of particles as 1.0 g of hydrogen.

- Today chemists define the mole as the number of atoms in 12.00 g of carbon-12.  

- The mole provides a bridge that allows us to compare numbers of particles by measuring mass or gaseous volume (see “map” below)

- The atomic mass units on the periodic table are the number of grams per mole (g/mol)!This is also called MOLAR MASS.
1 mole

## **The Mole Concept**

- 1 mole= The number of carbon atoms in 12.00 g of carbon=Avogadro’s number (NA)=6.02 x 10^23 particles




## *Example 1:* 
Compare the moles of atoms in 75.0 g of neon (Ne) and 75.0 g of argon (Ar).

75.0 g Ne 1 mol Ne20.18 g Ne=3.72 moles Ne
75.0 g Ar 1 mol Ar39.95 g Ar=1.88 moles Ar

## *Example 2:* 
How many grams of Iron (Fe) and Aluminum (Al) are needed to have 0.0351 moles of each?
0.0351 mol Fe 55.85 g Fe1 mol Fe=1.96 g Fe
0.0351 mol Al 26.89 g Al1 mol Ar=0.944 g Al
